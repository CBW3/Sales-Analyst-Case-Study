# Sales-Analyst-Case-Study
I analyze a large dataset containing descriptive characteristics of sales-related geospatial, time-series, and demographics data.

The dataset is ~287,000 rows & ~35 columns, containing information like Regions, Customer Characteristics, Time, Item Category,
Item Price, Item Quantity, Discount Applied, SKU Numbers, Order ID, etc. The dataset only includes information with respect to Fiscal Year 2020. 

In this case study, I cleaned the Excel file by using Data Validations Procedures, Removing Nulls/NA's/Blanks, and formatting Data Types among other things.

I then imported the dataset into Tableau for analysis. 

To see revenue per state, I created a United States heatmap with labels. T

To see revenue per month, I created a line chart. 

Next, I wanted to explore the target audience of these sales. To do so, I created a psuedo-histogram/column chart
showing the relationship between sales and age bins. 

Then, I wanted to explore if there was a correlation between quantity ordered and discount recieved. Intuitively, given my background in economics,
I thought that there would be a correlation. But, I wanted to validate this economic intuition by creating a scatter plot, calculating the exact correlation. 

I created a pie chart to explore the distribution between sales and regionality. 

Lastly, I wanted to explore revenue by category by gender. To do so, I created a butterfly chart. 

Finally, I aggregated all of this visual information into a Dashboard. 

Throughout this exercise, I utilized a variety of advanced Tableau concepts like calculated fields, creating non-standard charts like Butterfly Charts,
queried and coded certain information to create new fields, created bins for age information, and formatted the worksheet using colors and labels.

as well as the Excel file within this repository.
